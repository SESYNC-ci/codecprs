# Virtual Mini-Workshops

In addition to the on-site workshop at SESYNC, a number of 1-day virtual mini-workshops will be planned at hosting universities
around the world. These virtual workshops will support the same goals as the on-site workshop and will connect with the on-site
workshop from 1-4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Wednesday July 6, 2016 for presentation of their results and participation
in a panel discussion and town-hall meeting with the on-site workshop participants and leading experts in this area. In addition,
virtual participants will have the opportunity to generate and/or join the resulting working groups established by these
endeavors. If interested in hosting and co-leading a virtual workshop at your university or organization, please complete the
on-line application.
