# SESYNC Site Template

This jekyll template supports the following features:

* single top menu
* Sidebar fixed navigationo
* customizable copyright

# Style Examples

# H1 Header

## H2 Header

### H3 Header

*Bold*

This is some raw text

## Adding items to the top menu

Any page that has 'menu' listed in the header will be included in the top menu. Optionally, items may also have a 'menutitle' attribute to use a different name for the menu link. In the case of this page, we want it to show up as Home rather than the default Sample Page title.
