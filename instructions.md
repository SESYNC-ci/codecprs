# Workshop Details

## Dates
The on-site workshop will be held July 5-8, 2016, at SESYNC in Annapolis, Maryland, and will meet daily from 8 a.m. â€“ 5 p.m. with a daily break for lunch. The last day, Friday July 8, will be a half-day and the workshop will officially conclude at Noon. 

Virtual 1-day min-workshops will be scheduled in conjunction with the official co-leaders at each virtual host location and announced on the workshop web-site. Each potential hosting location must have a co-leader and primary point of contact who will work with the principal investigators to schedule and organize their virtual workshop. Only those interested in being a co-leader of a virtual workshop should complete the application, those interested in participating in a virtual mini-workshop should contact the co-leader(s) at their location. Anyone (grad. student, postdoc, faculty, etc.) may apply to be a co-leader of a  virtual mini-workshop (VMW).

## Fees and Expenses

There will be *no fee* to attend either the on-site or virtual mini-workshops. Most travel expenses, including airfare, accommodations, and some meals will be provided for on-site participants by SESYNC. No additional funding will be provided for virtual mini-workshops.

## Applicants

VMW co-leaders may also apply to participate in the on-site workshop but will need to assure that there is an additional co-leader at their location who can work virtually with SESYNC staff on July 6, 2016, to connect with the on-site workshop, present the results of their workshop, and facilitate participation in the panel and town hall discussions. 

Current graduate students and postdocs may apply for participation in the on-site workshop using the on-line application. 
*Applicants for the on-site workshop MUST also be willing to be a co-leader in organizing a virtual mini-workshop* at their home university or organization, assuring that you are prepared for fully active participation during the on-site workshop, if selected. 

Current faculty and/or professional practitioners should not apply for participation in the workshop. Because this workshop is focused on graduate students and postdocs as the emerging generation of researchers in this area, only a select group of up to ten experts will be invited to the workshop to represent the legacy of knowledge relating to each of the existing large-N databases. If you believe that you should be considered for one of these positions, please contact elicia.ratajczyk@asu.edu. 

## Style Examples

# H1 Header

## H2 Header

### H3 Header

*Bold*

This is some raw text

## Site Title

Open the _config.yml and edit the title and subtitle fields. They will appear in the upper right of every rendered page.

## Top Menu

Any page that has 'menu' listed in the header will be included in the top menu. Optionally, items may also have a 'menutitle' attribute to use a different name for the menu link. In the case of this page, we want it to show up as Home rather than the default Sample Page title. You can take a look at page1.md and notice it only has the 'menu' option specifying its the first one.

Please note, the actual files for menus can be named anything.

## Editing the sidebar

Edit the markdown file located at _includes/sidebar.md. Below is what that file looks like. You can use the following items in a sidebar

* '#' h1 header
* '##' h2 header
* '*' list item
* links

<pre>

{% include sidebar.md %}
